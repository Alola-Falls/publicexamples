# Fixed aspect ratio
This example shows a render script where the original aspect ratio is maintained regardless of how the window is resized. The area visible using the original screen size will always be visible, either centered if the window dimensions are larger, or zoomed out if either window width or height is smaller than the original size.

## Orthographic Camera API
For a more up-to-date and easier to use orthographic camera with support for a fixed aspect ration please check the [defold-orthographic](https://github.com/britzl/defold-orthographic) library project.
